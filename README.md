# heretical
This is the source code to the first aRtEffECt demoscene release. Code by SSG, Graphics by Cori, Music by Heretic himself.

# ssg's notes
I developed this on DJGPP using RHIDE, so no makefiles, sorry. I removed project files too as I see them obsolete, but should be straightforward to build it if needed. It used Allegro graphics library and MIKMOD for module playing. 
One of the first finished products that I developed on C, I was very fond of Pascal back then.

I was not able to open any pictures on my current Windows installation, very old file formats but it contains some nostalgic stuff I'm sure, like the first sketches of the musicdisk interface I created on Autodesk Animator Pro using mouse.
